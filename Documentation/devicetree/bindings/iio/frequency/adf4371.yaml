  clock-scales:
    description:
      The Common Clock Framework max rate is limited by MAX of unsigned long.
      For ADF4371/ADF4372 devices this is a deficiency. If specified, this
      property allows arbitrary scales. The first element in the array should
      be the multiplier and the second element should be the divider.

      - minimum: 1

  adi,mute-till-lock-en:
    description:
      If this property is present, then the supply current to RF8P and RF8N
      output stage will shut down until the ADF4371/ADF4372 achieves lock as
      measured by the digital lock detect circuitry.
